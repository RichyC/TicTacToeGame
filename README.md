# TicTacToeGame
I coded a simple TicTacToe game using JavaFX and other Java libraries

This TicTacToe game is a simply coded game using if/else statements, boolean values, event-driven programming, and JavaFX. 

Initially, two windows will appear on the screen upon compilation and running. The smaller window will prompt player one to choose their playing symbol, an X or O. Next, Player 2 gets the first turn and one must move the smaller window to the left. The small window will present which player's turn it is. The player must choose a space to mark with their symbol. Once the space is marked, the space cannot be chosen anymore. First player to get three spaces in a row from any direction wins. If nobody ones, one player must click the quit button. If somebody wins, the TicTacToe board will erase itself and present the winner through text on the screen. 

Clicking the "Quit" button or exiting all windows will exit the game. 

If nobody wins, the game will not exit by itself. A player must click "Quit" or exit all windows.
